# Setting up Dremio, DBT, Power BI Desktop
## Setting up Dremio OSS
### Preparing the Docker file and setting up the Dremio services
We will install `Dremio OSS` via `Docker Compose`. So, we need to prepare the `Docker compose` file with following content:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  dremio:
    image: dremio/dremio-oss:24.2.5
    ports:
      - 9047:9047 # UI
      - 31010:31010 # ODBC clients
      - 32010:32010 # Arrow Flight clients
      - 2181:2181   # ZooKeeper
      - 45678:45678 # internode communication
    volumes:
      - /data/dremio/data/:/opt/dremio/data/
      - /data/dremio/conf/:/opt/dremio/conf/
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      local_internal:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.80.2

  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    # NOTE: use of "mysql_native_password" is not recommended: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html#upgrade-caching-sha2-password
    # (this is just an example, not intended to be a production configuration)
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3307:3306
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: pwd@123
    networks:
      local_internal:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.80.3

networks:
  local_internal:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.80.0/24

```
And you have to prepare a file `dremio.conf` to configure custom properties as well. For example, in this tutorial, we will use local file system to store Dremio's data including job results, downloads, uploads, accelerators, etc.

```yaml
paths: {

  # the local path for dremio to store data.
  local: "/opt/dremio",

  # the distributed path Dremio data including job results, downloads, uploads, etc
  dist: "file://"${paths.local}"/pdfs"

  # location for catalog database (if master node)
  db: ${paths.local}/db,

  spilling: [${paths.local}/spill]

  # storage area for the accelerator cache.
  accelerator: ${paths.dist}/accelerator

  # staging area for json and csv ui downloads
  downloads: ${paths.dist}/downloads

  # stores uploaded data associated with user home directories
  uploads: ${paths.dist}/uploads

  # stores data associated with the job results cache.
  results: ${paths.dist}/results

  # shared scratch space for creation of tables.
  scratch: ${paths.dist}/scratch

}
```
> *NOTE*: In production deployment, you should use distributed file system or storage object such as S3, HDFS, etc. 

> *You have to copy the file `dremio.conf` to the right directory defined in the `Docker compose` file.*

Next step, running following commands to download docker images, install and start components:

```shell
# enter the dremio directory
cd ~/dremio
# copy the custom configuration file into the directory mapped with the Dremio docker
cp dremio.conf /data/dremio/conf/
# run docker compose
docker compose up
```

The Dremio should be started properly. Afterward, you can access the Admin Web UI at the address *http://localhost:9047*.

You have to initialize your account for the first time. For example:
![iniatlize_dremio_account.png](images%2Finiatlize_dremio_account.png)

### Accessing the data with Dremio
Let's begin by creating a new space. Click on the plus sign next to Spaces and add a space called `dev`. This space will contain our views and virtual models that will be created in next steps.
![create_sapce.png](images%2Fcreate_sapce.png)

Next step, we will create a sample source. We will work with the police incidents data stored on S3. Navigate to Samples in the Sources section on the bottom left. Then click on samples.dremio.com:
![add_sample_source.png](images%2Fadd_sample_source.png)

Next step, on `Object Storage` section, we go to the path `Samples > samples.dremio.com > NYC-taxi-trips-iceberg`, then click on button `Format Folder` on left hand side to format the dataset.
![sample_iceberg_dataset.png](images%2Fsample_iceberg_dataset.png)

On next screen, preview sample of the data and click on `Save` button to confirm the format.

![format_iceberg_file.png](images%2Fformat_iceberg_file.png)
Dremio supports many types of files, including Excel, JSON, Parquet, and others. With some file formats there are required configurations (e.g., field delimiter, line delimiter).

### Exploring dataset
Now, you can start to query on the dataset. For example, you can run the following query to preview sample of the dataset:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Samples."samples.dremio.com"."NYC-taxi-trips-iceberg" LIMIT 100
```
![simple_query.png](images%2Fsimple_query.png)

### Saving as View on the working space
Click on `Save View as` button to save the current query as view on your working space such as `dev` with a name `nyc_taxi_trips`:

![save_as_view.png](images%2Fsave_as_view.png)

Now, you can query this view as following commands:
```sql
SELECT * FROM dev."nyc_taxi_trips" LIMIT 100
```
![query_on_dev_space.png](images%2Fquery_on_dev_space.png)


### Accelerating your queries with `Reflections`
#### A paradigm shift for query acceleration: 
*A Reflection is an optimized relational cache of source data that can be used to speed-up data processing*. Dremio's query optimizer can accelerate a query against tables or Views by using one or more Reflections to partially or entirely satisfy that query, eliminating the need to process all of the raw data in the underlying data sources. Queries do not need to reference Reflections directly. Instead, Dremio rewrites queries on the fly to use matching Reflections, delivering near-instantaneous query results and reduced compute cost.

#### Create a Raw reflection for your models
You can create them to accelerate common SQL aggregations or for raw Reflections across table joins or unoptimized data.

Select the `Reflections` tab to enter the reflection configuration. Next step, you can choose to enable either `Raw Reflections` or `Aggregation Reflections`. 

On the `Raw Reflections` tab, click on `Raw Reflections` to enable reflection for the current model. Next, you can click on button `Dataset Settings`⚙️ on the top right hand side to popup a windows to configure a scheduler for reflection.

![reflection_configuration.png](images%2Freflection_configuration.png)

- Refresh methods: Dremio provides two options to refresh data:
  - Full update:
  - Incremental update:
- Refresh policy:
  - Refresh:
    - Never
    - Interval: Hour(s)/ Day(s)/ Week(s) or Now
  - Expire:
    - Never
    - After: Hour(s)/ Day(s)/ Week(s)

You can monitor status of the reflection jobs on the `Jobs` section.

![reflection_job.png](images%2Freflection_job.png)

Click on the `Job ID` link to move to detailed page, where you can find more information about the job, including its status, resource usage, etc. These details are helpful for debuging if needed.

![monitor_detailed_refection_job.png](images%2Fmonitor_detailed_refection_job.png)

#### Creating an Aggregation reflection
On the `Reflections` tab, choose the `Aggregation reflections`, then click on `Aggregation reflections` button to enable reflection. Next, you need to configure the dimensions and metrics for your aggregation model.

![enable_agg_reflection.png](images%2Fenable_agg_reflection.png)
> **NOTE:** You can create multiple reflections for a model as needed. When you run a query that utilizes your base model, Dremio automatically optimizes the query by selecting a suitable reflection to accelerate its execution.

### Combining data from multiple source with Dremio's Federation query
#### Accessing data from OLTP database - MySQL db

![mysql_local_connection.png](images%2Fmysql_local_connection.png)

![mysql_local_connection_reflection_refresh.png](images%2Fmysql_local_connection_reflection_refresh.png)

![mysql_local_connection_metadata.png](images%2Fmysql_local_connection_metadata.png)

#### Federation query
Now, you can write the federation query that combines data from S3 source and MySQL source:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM "mysql-local".dremio."SF_incidents2016"
)
UNION ALL (
    SELECT * FROM "Samples"."samples.dremio.com"."SF_incidents2016.json"
)
```

![federation_query.png](images%2Ffederation_query.png)

Saving the query result as a view in the `dev` space for future use.

![save_as_view_2.png](images%2Fsave_as_view_2.png)

You can save it as script for future reuse as well.

![save_as_script.png](images%2Fsave_as_script.png)

### Adding wiki for your models
Dremio allow you to add a wiki for your model, providing a guide for users on how to utilize your dataset 

![wiki.png](images%2Fwiki.png)

You can add one or many tags/ labels to your model as well.

## Setting up DBT
