# Setting up Dremio, DBT, Power BI Desktop
## Setting up Dremio OSS
### Preparing the Docker file and setting up the Dremio services
We will install `Dremio OSS` via `Docker Compose`. So, we need to prepare the `Docker compose` file with following content:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  dremio:
    image: dremio/dremio-oss:24.2.5
    ports:
      - 9047:9047 # UI
      - 31010:31010 # ODBC clients
      - 32010:32010 # Arrow Flight clients
      - 2181:2181   # ZooKeeper
      - 45678:45678 # internode communication
    volumes:
      - /data/dremio/data/:/opt/dremio/data/
      - /data/dremio/conf/:/opt/dremio/conf/
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      local_internal:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.80.2

  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    # NOTE: use of "mysql_native_password" is not recommended: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html#upgrade-caching-sha2-password
    # (this is just an example, not intended to be a production configuration)
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3307:3306
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: pwd@123
    networks:
      local_internal:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.80.3

networks:
  local_internal:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.80.0/24

```
And you have to prepare a file `dremio.conf` to configure custom properties as well. For example, in this tutorial, we will use local file system to store Dremio's data including job results, downloads, uploads, accelerators, etc.

```yaml
paths: {

  # the local path for dremio to store data.
  local: "/opt/dremio",

  # the distributed path Dremio data including job results, downloads, uploads, etc
  dist: "file://"${paths.local}"/pdfs"

  # location for catalog database (if master node)
  db: ${paths.local}/db,

  spilling: [${paths.local}/spill]

  # storage area for the accelerator cache.
  accelerator: ${paths.dist}/accelerator

  # staging area for json and csv ui downloads
  downloads: ${paths.dist}/downloads

  # stores uploaded data associated with user home directories
  uploads: ${paths.dist}/uploads

  # stores data associated with the job results cache.
  results: ${paths.dist}/results

  # shared scratch space for creation of tables.
  scratch: ${paths.dist}/scratch

}
```
> *NOTE*: In production deployment, you should use distributed file system or storage object such as S3, HDFS, etc. 

> *You have to copy the file `dremio.conf` to the right directory defined in the `Docker compose` file.*

Next step, running following commands to download docker images, install and start components:

```shell
# enter the dremio directory
cd ~/dremio
# copy the custom configuration file into the directory mapped with the Dremio docker
cp dremio.conf /data/dremio/conf/
# run docker compose
docker compose up
```

The Dremio should be started properly. Afterward, you can access the Admin Web UI at the address *http://localhost:9047*.

You have to initialize your account for the first time. For example:

### Accessing the data with Dremio
Let's begin by creating a new space. Click on the plus sign next to Spaces and add a space called `dev`. This space will contain our views and virtual models that will be created in next steps.
![create_sapce.png](images%2Fcreate_sapce.png)

Next step, we will create a sample source. We will work with the police incidents data stored on S3. Navigate to Samples in the Sources section on the bottom left. Then click on samples.dremio.com:
![add_sample_source.png](images%2Fadd_sample_source.png)

Next step, on `Object Storage` section, we go to the path `Samples > samples.dremio.com > NYC-taxi-trips-iceberg`, then click on button `Format Folder` on left hand side to format the dataset.
![sample_iceberg_dataset.png](images%2Fsample_iceberg_dataset.png)

On next screen, preview sample of the data and click on `Save` button to confirm the format.

![format_iceberg_file.png](images%2Fformat_iceberg_file.png)
Dremio supports many types of files, including Excel, JSON, Parquet, and others. With some file formats there are required configurations (e.g., field delimiter, line delimiter).

### Exploring dataset
Now, you can start to query on the dataset. For example, you can run the following query to preview sample of the dataset:
```sql
SELECT * FROM "NYC-taxi-trips-iceberg" LIMIT 100
```
